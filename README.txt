Maze simulator is a first person, three-dimensional, take on solving a two-dimensional maze implemented with JavaSctript and WebGL. The maze is generated from a matrix of cells using loop-erased random walks (aka Wilsons algorithm). Parameters of the maze can be modified including maze dimensions, cell size, wall thickness, wall height, material lighting, textures, player height, player speed, player acceleration and mouse sensitivity. The player's initial position is on the opposite corner from the exit. When the player exits the maze, the game is terminated.
Collision detection is computed on a cell to cell bases. Each cell includes a set of four binary values representing the existence of a wall in each cardinal direction. The player's global position is used to calculate current cell which is the basis for computing the collision detection.
