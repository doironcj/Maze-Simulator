Maze simulator is a first person 3d take on solving a 2d maze implemented with javasctript and webgl.  When a maze is generated from a matrix of cells using a loop-erased random walks or wilsons algorithm.  All perameters including hight of walls, width of walls, size of cell, and dimensions of cell matrix can be modified along with lighting.  Textures may also be set for asthetic.  The players initial position is on the opposite corner from the exit.  Player speed, acceleration and height may all be modified.  When the player exits the maze, the game is terminated. 
Collision detection is computed on a cell bases.  Each sell has a value for each wall in the four cardinal directions.  The current cell is computed from the global location of the player and the collision detection is done for that local cell.
